
# Feat: Landing Page Project Updates

This project utilizes JavaScript to create an interactive webpage for the user. The navigation bar is dynamically built based on the number of sections in
the webpage. Each navigation link will scroll to the corresponding section. The section that is in view will have circles appear. The project was tested on 
performance and refractored accordingly.
